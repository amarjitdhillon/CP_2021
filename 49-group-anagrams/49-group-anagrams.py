    - As each char consists of lowercase English letters, so we can use the list of 26 lengths to represent each word
    - Loop over each word in the given input list
    - Create a hashmap of type {tuple: list}, where the key is a tuple of frequency count of length 26 representing each char of English alphabet and values is a list of anagrams for that tupleÂ 
    - If two frequency tuples match, then append the current word to the end of this values list in the hashmap
    - f the tuple key is not present in the hashmap, then create a new key(tuple) and value pair (current word).
    - If the tuple key is present, then add the current word to the values list of the hashmap.
    - At the end, return the hashmap.values()
